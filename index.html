            <p>My name is Josh Lin and I am a graduate of Saint Louis University with a Bachelor's degree in IT administration. I first worked with Caleres as a Help desk support, then later became a night shift operator. Night shift was not fun.</p>

            <p>I was told to write about a trip, so here it is: I went to Greece in September. Things were cheap and food was bland. At least the sights were nice and I was with friends! 5/10, would travel to a tastier place.</p>

            <p>My biggest hobby seems to be hoarding electronics. I have a ps2, 2 psps, and 2 ps vitas. I might have a problem...</p>
